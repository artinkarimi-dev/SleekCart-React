## 🛠 Tech Stack & Architecture

| Category           | Technology                           |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Core Framework** | React 18 (Functional Components)     |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS (Custom Neon Shadows)   |
| **Primitive UI** | Radix UI (Dropdown Menu)             |
| **Icons** | React Icons (FA, Md, Io)             |
| **Build Tool** | Vite                                 |

### 🧠 Technical Highlights

1.  **State Centralization:** Managed the entire application state in `App.jsx`, utilizing "Lifting State Up" to sync data between independent components like Header and Footer.
2.  **Logic Optimization:** Used high-order Array methods (`filter`, `reduce`, `find`) to handle complex cart calculations with $O(n)$ efficiency.
3.  **UI Consistency:** Implemented a unified Dark Mode palette using Tailwind’s utility-first approach to ensure visual harmony across all breakpoints.
